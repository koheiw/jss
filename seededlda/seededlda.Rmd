## Algorithms

To infer the document-topic distribution $\theta$ and the topic-word distribution $\phi$, assigned topics are saved in $M_{dk}$ and $N_{kv}$. The former is the frequency of topic k found in document $d$, the latter is the frequency of topic $k$ assigned to unique word $v$, and $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ are the Dirichlet priors, which are added to the frequency counts to smooth the distributions in $\theta$ and $\phi$.  The Gibbs sampler assigns topics to the words in the corpus based on the sampling distribution, $G$, derived as a product of $\theta$ and $\phi$. These relationships between are defined as follows:

$$
\begin{split}
G = P(Z=k|W=v,d)\propto\theta_{dk}\phi_{kv} \\
\theta_{dk} = P(Z=k|d,\alpha_k) = \frac{M_{dk}+\alpha_k}{M_{d.}+\sum\alpha_k} \\
\phi_{kv} = P(W=v|k,\beta_k) = \frac{N_{kv}+\beta_k}{N_{k.}+\sum\beta_k}
\end{split}
$$

![
Graphical model of a simple LDA. Gray circles are variables whose values are known, 
whereas white circles are latent variables whose values are unknown. $\theta$ and $\phi$ 
are the $|D| \times K$ and $K \times |V|$ matrices, respectively; $Z$ is a vector to record 
topics words, $W$, in document $d$; $d$ is one of the documents $d \in D$; $v$ is one of the 
unique words $v \in V$ in the corpus.
